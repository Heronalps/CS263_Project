# GO_AWS_Lambda
Spring 2017 CS263 Project repo.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Implement profiling for Go AWS Lambda functions. Test, stress, use, and extend this FaaS system (single node and multinode). Write a set of different go functions from scratch that you use to do something interesting in the system. Run a series of performance analyses on the example functions and your functions, present the data (resource use, throughput, RTT, etc). Extend to provide rabbitMQ/celery background tasking service to spawn asynchronous, long running tasks. Determine how to error check, kill, prevent task bombs, and enable other robustness features.
